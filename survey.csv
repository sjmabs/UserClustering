However, the way I use AI has benefited me a lot and helped me especially during gcse revision. I would never use it to generate an essay for example which I would hand it to school or for example a history project. Instead I use it to mark my work especially subjects where there is no concrete mark scheme. For example, I will write a 25 marker for history and carefully plan it and learn all the content and then paste it into chat gpt so that it can mark it as its very hard to mark myself.  This has been super helpful during study leave as I have been able to get an estimate of the quality of my work. I am always careful to check the information that chat gpt gives me and I never rely on it heavily for information in any way. I have even found multiple mistakes regarding information it generates which is why it’s a dangerous tool to use. I know a few people in the year group who use it and I can see how it’s not benefitting them in any way as they use it to do their work without actually putting any effort in. But for me it has been seriously helpful. It’s also good at summarising notes if you have a lot and it can generate very intricate time tables which is great. Hope this helps!!!"
